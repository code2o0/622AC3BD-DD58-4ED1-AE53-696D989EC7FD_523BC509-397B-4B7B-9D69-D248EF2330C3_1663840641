                1. There is no sound in the client player: Please try to change the rtsp playing protocol of the rtsp player to UDP, and we also recommend using UDP.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. The client player is prohibited from playing the screen: Since each player handles RTSP differently, please try the following methods to solve the problem
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Please try to set the player's RTSP playback protocol to UDP
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Please try to set the player's decoder to hard/soft decoding
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Please try other players. We recommend VLC players
                </p>

            <p>
                3. The motion detection does not take effect: The effective condition of the motion detection is that when a target changes for 0.5 - 1.0 seconds, the motion detection will take effect. If it does not take effect, please increase the motion detection sensitivity. At the same time, it should be noted that too small targets will not be included in the mobile detection scope. Please adjust the mobile detection configuration according to the actual environment.
